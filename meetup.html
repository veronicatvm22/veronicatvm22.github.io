                  <p>Meet Ups are every Tuesday from 11AM to 5PM. Fun fact – Noisebridge is the oldest hacker space in the USA.</p>
                   <br>
                  <p> Free Code Camp Meet Ups at Noisebridge are a self-directed affair, but there is always 
                      someone there who can answer your questions.</p>
                  <br>
                
                  <p>I was working on grids during my visit on November 26th and was able to get a few questions answered.</p>
                   <br>
                  <p>Noisebridge is a very relaxed space with lots of room to spread out. They even have computers if you can't bring your own!</p>
