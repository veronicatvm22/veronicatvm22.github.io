        <h2 class="needgardens"> Why Do Children Need Gardens?</h2>

            
        <p class="pmain">For most of us, the fast pace of the twenty-first century means over-scheduled lives and a dearth of time to spend outside. And when face-to-face communication is replaced by a binary code, a loss of connection to who we are, and what really matters often occurs.</p>
        
        <h3 class="needgardens"> Connection!</h3>
        
        <p class="pmain">Children need gardens to connect to each other, to their food, and to themselves. They need a place of refuge, a place to slow down, to have hands-on experiences that enable them to learn how to read “the Great Book of Nature.”</p>
