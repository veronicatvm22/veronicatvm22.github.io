        <!-- Code modified by Veronica Voss-Macomber September 21, 2019
        Brief summary of changes: added opening and/or closing tags when needed, changed tags to lowercase, added DTD,meta elements and attributes, added images and coded with appropriate alt info, moved section tags to enclose a section of the document and indented the code so that(for me) it is a readable, organized document.-->

<h1 style="text-align:center;">CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1>
    
         <p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
    
         <p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code. The basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>

    The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind!</p>

<h2>Building an Unordered List</h2>
    
        <p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded.<br>
        We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
        and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
    
        <p><strong>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</strong></p>
